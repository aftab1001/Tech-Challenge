Implementation of Package	Challenge. I have used KnapSack Alogrithm to find the optimal Indexes.

## Installation

Use a node js environment to run this project.
```
npm install
npm run start
```
The ```package.json``` contains the main script to run the whole program: In Package.json change the name of file if you want to do the testing with a different File. Also place the file in the testCases Directory. You can also change the directory Name from constants class.
```
"scripts": {
   "start": "node src/index.js test00.txt"
}
```

## OutPut
The system will generate output file in the result folder and output file name Result.txt . You can change the output file name from Constant.js

## Unit Testing

I have writtend test cases using mocha

## Logging
I have used winston logging, and logging all the excetpions.
